# YAINN
## Yet Another Introduction to Neural Networks

*documentation still under construction, code is pretty much ready*
*Please check the ```experiments``` package to find a decent starting point for your journey*

Welcome the source code of my blog "Yet another introduction to neural networks"!

Since this is a scala project, you'll find all sources in src/main/scala. 
The main package is org.smurve.yainn, and from there you'll find the following packages

 - components: the various functional layers
 - data: the iterators that provide the input values (images)
 - experiments: executable classes demonstrating the learning success
 - worksheets: some interactive worksheets to play with
 

 
###  Install linear algebra libraries
 - OpenBLAS 
 
### Experiments are variants, not versions
